# Predictive Maintenance Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance system using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to predict the failure of machinery or components before they occur, thus reducing downtime, maintenance costs, and improving overall operational efficiency. The project uses a dataset that includes various features related to the operational conditions of the machinery, and aims to build a model that can accurately predict when a failure is likely to happen.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ele10-code/Predictive-Maintenance.git
   cd Predictive-Maintenance
   ```
   
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**: 
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install the required packages**:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains several features related to the operating conditions and status of the machinery. These features may include temperature, pressure, vibration, and more. The data is divided into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

- Raw data: The original data files, typically in CSV format, are located in the `data/raw/` directory.
- Processed data: Cleaned and transformed data ready for modeling is stored in the data/processed/ directory.
- 
## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Scaling and normalization
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- These steps are implemented in the scripts/data_preprocessing.py script.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a critical step in building a predictive maintenance model. This process includes creating new features that may capture important patterns in the data related to equipment failures. Examples of features might include:

- Rolling averages of sensor readings
- Lag features
- Polynomial features
The feature engineering process is documented in the `notebooks/02_feature_engineering.ipynb¡ notebook and implemented in the ¡scripts/feature_engineering.py¡ script.

## Modeling
Various machine learning models are evaluated to predict machinery failure, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machines
- Support Vector Machines
The `notebooks/03_modeling.ipynb` notebook contains the modeling process, including model selection and hyperparameter tuning. The final trained model is saved in the models/ directory.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using several metrics, including:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
ROC-AUC
The evaluation results are documented in the notebooks/04_evaluation.ipynb notebook and saved in models/model_performance.json.

## Usage
To use the trained model to make predictions on new data, follow these steps:

1. **Load the model**:
```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('models/trained_model.pkl')
```
2. **Make predictions**:
```python
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```
