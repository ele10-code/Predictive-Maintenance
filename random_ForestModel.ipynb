    "   - Il dataset originale contiene 6,678,924 righe e 7 colonne.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Feature engineering:\n",
    "   - Sono state create con successo nuove feature temporali (hour, day_of_week, month, is_weekend).\n",
    "   - Sono state applicate trasformazioni logaritmiche a 'value' e 'event_reference_value'.\n",
    "   - Non ci sono valori infiniti o NaN nelle colonne selezionate per le interazioni.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interazioni:\n",
    "   - Sono state create interazioni polinomiali tra le colonne selezionate.\n",
    "   - Le interazioni manuali 'interaction_value_reference' e 'interaction_hour_day' sono state create con successo.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dimensioni finali:\n",
    "   - Il dataframe finale ha 58 colonne, indicando che sono state create 51 nuove feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Statistiche descrittive:\n",
    "   - Le statistiche per 'value' e 'event_reference_value' mostrano una grande variabilità nei dati.\n",
    "   - Le trasformazioni logaritmiche ('value_log' e 'event_reference_value_log') hanno ridotto questa variabilità.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Colonna mancante:\n",
    "   - 'value_rate_of_change_clean' non è presente nel dataset finale. Questo potrebbe essere dovuto al fatto che 'value_rate_of_change' non era presente nel dataset originale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Osservazioni e suggerimenti:\n",

    "1. Il processo di feature engineering sembra essere stato eseguito con successo, creando numerose nuove feature senza introdurre valori problematici (infiniti o NaN).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. La grande quantità di nuove feature (51) potrebbe portare a problemi di dimensionalità elevata. Considera di utilizzare tecniche di selezione delle feature o di riduzione della dimensionalità in fase di modellazione.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Le interazioni manuali sono state create correttamente, ma potresti voler verificare se 'interaction_hour_day' ha il comportamento desiderato, dato che i suoi valori sembrano essere tutti 132 nelle prime righe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. La mancanza di 'value_rate_of_change_clean' suggerisce che potresti voler aggiungere questa feature se è rilevante per la tua analisi.\n",
